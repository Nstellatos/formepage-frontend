For Me Page is an app built for lovers of TikTok! 

For Me Page is a SPA using vanilla javascript and rails api.

How it works:
Create a category based on your interests. Then head over to TikTok and copy the link of a video you would like to save.  Paste that link into the ‘add a video’ form and select a category from the dropdown. Upload the video! 

Now you no longer have to search through your likes on TikTok for that one cooking video you saw weeks ago.

This app uses iframe. Not only will you be able to sort your videos by category but you can also play them!
